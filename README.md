# Workshop Description

A sequence motif is a short pattern for DNA, RNA or amino acid sequence with biological significance.
The motifs are often represented as a matrices such as position weight matrix (PWM) and visualized as sequence logos.
The motifStack package is designed for graphic representation of multiple motifs as a phylogenetic tree.
This tool faciliates the analysis of diversity or conservation of a group of transcription factor binding sites.
This package has been well downloaded by researchers and cited in various journals. 
The tool is easy to learn and use. Sample codes will be provided for users to change for their own data. 
It will take about 50 min to master the package.

# Workshop goals and objectives

List "big picture" student-centered workshop goals and learning
objectives. Learning goals and objectives are related, but not the
same thing. These goals and objectives will help some people to decide
whether to attend the conference for training purposes, so please make
these as precise and accurate as possible.

*Learning goals* are high-level descriptions of what
participants will learn and be able to do after the workshop is
over. *Learning objectives*, on the other hand, describe in very
specific and measurable terms specific skills or knowledge
attained. The [Bloom's Taxonomy](#bloom) may be a useful framework
for defining and describing your goals and objectives, although there
are others.

## Learning goals

Some examples:

* describe how to...
* identify methods for...
* understand the difference between...

## Learning objectives

* analyze xyz data to produce...
* create xyz plots
* evaluate xyz data for artifacts

### A note about learning goals and objectives (#bloom)

While not a new or modern system for thinking about learning,
[Bloom's taxonomy][1] is one useful framework for understanding the
cognitive processes involved in learning. From lowest to highest
cognitive requirements:

1. Knowledge: Learners must be able to recall or remember the
   information.
2. Comprehension: Learners must be able to understand the information.
3. Application: Learners must be able to use the information they have
   learned at the same or different contexts.
4. Analysis: Learners must be able to analyze the information, by
   identifying its different components.
5. Synthesis: Learners must be able to create something new using
   different chunks of the information they have already mastered.
6. Evaluation: Learners must be able to present opinions, justify
   decisions, and make judgments about the information presented,
   based on previously acquired knowledge.

To use Bloom's taxonomy, consider the following sets of verbs and
descriptions for learning objectives:

1. Remember: Memorize, show, pick, spell, list, quote, recall, repeat,
   catalogue, cite, state, relate, record, name.
2. Understand: Explain, restate, alter, outline, discuss, expand,
   identify, locate, report, express, recognize, discuss, qualify,
   covert, review, infer.
3. Apply: Translate, interpret, explain, practice, illustrate,
   operate, demonstrate, dramatize, sketch, put into action, complete,
   model, utilize, experiment, schedule, use.
4. Analyze: Distinguish, differentiate, separate, take apart,
   appraise, calculate, criticize, compare, contrast, examine, test,
   relate, search, classify, experiment.
5. Evaluate: Decide, appraise, revise, score, recommend, select,
   measure, argue, value, estimate, choose, discuss, rate, assess,
   think.
6. Create: Compose, plan, propose, produce, predict, design, assemble,
   prepare, formulate, organize, manage, construct, generate, imagine,
   set-up.
