# Workshop Description

A sequence motif is a short pattern for DNA, RNA or amino acid sequence with biological significance.
The motifs are often represented as a matrices such as position weight matrix (PWM) and visualized as sequence logos.
The motifStack package is designed for graphic representation of multiple motifs as a phylogenetic tree.
This tool faciliates the analysis of diversity or conservation of a group of transcription factor binding sites.
This package has been well downloaded by researchers and cited in various journals. 
The tool is easy to learn and use. Sample codes will be provided for users to change for their own data. 
It will take about 50 min to master the package.

*Expectation:* After this workshop, participants should be able to plot motif stacks by their own data.

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Basic knowledge of sequence motifs

## Workshop Participation

Users who are interested in graphic representation of multiple motifs. Participants are expected to have motifStack package installed in their own computer or pull the motifStack docker from https://hub.docker.com/r/jianhong/motifstack
